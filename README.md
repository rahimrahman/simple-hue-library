# Philip Hue Simple Library

Library to be used in my Josh.ai challenge terminal application and React-Native application.

This is not on npm, so package need to be added manually.

```
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "simple-hue-library": "git@github.com:rahimrahman/simple-hue-library.git",
    ...
  }
```
